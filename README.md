# C-Learning 🧠💻

This repository tracks my daily progress in learning the C programming language.  
I'm following the [CodeWithHarry C tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ah7DDtYtflgwMwpT3xmjXY9) and [C programming Course Online by GeeksforGeeks(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/c-foundation?tab=Chapters)] and practicing every day.

## 🔥 Progress Log

- ✅ Day 1 & Day 2: Basics, `printf`, variables, and simple I/O
- ✅ Day 3 & Day 4: Conditional statements, loops, and practice problems

## 📁 Folders

- `Practice/` - Contains daily C programs and exercises

## 🚀 Goal

To build a strong foundation in C programming before moving to Data Structures, Algorithms, and eventually AI/ML.
